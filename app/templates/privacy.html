  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 6, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt Optimization Web App</strong> is a web application that helps users improve the clarity and effectiveness of prompts sent to AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini by optimizing their wording, style, and structure.</p>

  <p>This application does <strong>not</strong> require user registration or authentication and does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information about its users.</p>

  <p>When you submit a prompt, the text you enter is transmitted temporarily to an external optimization server (hosted by the developer) solely for the purpose of generating a clearer and more effective version of the prompt. No personal data is included in this process, and the prompt content is not stored, logged, or used for any other purpose beyond the immediate optimization request.</p>

  <p>This site uses browser cookies to maintain session state for interactive features. These cookies do not contain personal information and are used only to temporarily store your input during your session. Once the session ends or you close your browser, this data is cleared.</p>

  <p>The application integrates with third-party AI services and APIs. By using this application, you acknowledge that your prompt content may be processed by those external services according to their own privacy policies.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you may contact the developer via the <a href='https://github.com/augustosouza8/prompt-optimizer-web-app'>GitHub repository</a>.</p>

  <p>By using this web application, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
